<h3>Background</h3>
EGit is an Eclipse plugin which allows to use the distributed version control system Git directly within the Eclipse IDE.
EGit is based on the JGit library. JGit is a library which implements the Git functionality in Java.

<h4>Installation</h4>
The EGit plugin can be installed into every Eclipse IDE installation. 
Usually EGit supports the last two Eclipse releases. 

<p>
Most Eclipse 4.2 (Juno) and Eclipse 4.3 (Kepler) downloads from Eclipse.org contain EGit in their default configuration. 
In this case no additional installation is required.
